Simulation Complete.
Nb Response: 64


Scheduling simulation, Processor TPC_1-SM_1 : 

- Number of context switches :  34
- Number of preemptions :  0

- Task response time computed from simulation : 
    DAG1-Kernel1-Block1 => 7/worst 
    DAG1-Kernel3-Block1 => 19/worst 
    DAG2-Kernel1-Block1 => 19/worst 
    DAG2-Kernel3-Block1 => 19/worst 
- No deadline missed in the computed scheduling : the task set is schedulable if you computed the scheduling on the feasibility interval.


- Number of context switches :  36
